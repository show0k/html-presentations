Note:
Hi, I'm Théo Segonds, A master intern at Flowers lab in INRIA. I'm here with my internship supervisor, Pierre Rouanet. I'll present you the poppy project, a robotic platform made for research art and education, and how to connect a Poppy robot to Snap!.

I'll first present you the FLowers Lab and the Poppy Project, and after I'll show you a demonstration of what we can do with Snap! and a poppy robot.

Note:
A project team at INRIA Bordeaux and ENSTA Paris. The main research field of the lab is about developmental robotics.
Developmental robotics is a scientific field which aims at studying mechanisms and architecture that allow learning of new skills and new knowledges in embodied machines. 

Three Years ago, as part of Matthieu Lapeyre thesis on biped locomotion, we needed a robot that allow us to explore morphology. This is how the poppy project is born
